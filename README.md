# Anganwadi-Management-System
Anganwadi Management System is a digital tool to manage records of children, mothers, staff, and nutrition services at Anganwadi centers, improving efficiency and transparency


The Anganwadi Management System is a web-based application developed to digitize and streamline the daily operations of Anganwadi centers under the ICDS scheme in India. These centers provide essential services such as nutrition, health checkups, and early education to children under six years and to pregnant or lactating women.

This system replaces traditional paper-based records with a centralized digital database, making it easier to manage and monitor child and mother registrations, staff details, nutrition inventory, attendance, and health tracking. Built using **PHP, HTML, CSS, and MySQL**, the platform ensures better efficiency, accuracy, and transparency in service delivery. It also supports the generation of reports for administrative review and government audits.

The project helps Anganwadi workers focus more on care and outreach while reducing manual workload, ultimately contributing to improved public health and child development outcomes.
